From Squeak - The Upstream Sources of the SqueakVM
==================================================

This directory contains the upstream sources of the SqueakVM.
Currently, we are only sharing the code for VM plugins.

The subdirectories contain the platform specific code for the platform
indicated by the folders name.

The `intplugins` folder contains the sources generated by VMMaker.
That is, it contains the sources for iOS and unix plugins.
They happen to be identical beside that some plugins are not supported for
both platforms.
